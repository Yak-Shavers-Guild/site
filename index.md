# Yak Shavers Guild

> [MIT AI Lab, after 2000: orig. probably from a <cite>Ren & Stimpy</cite> episode.] Any seemingly pointless activity which is actually necessary to solve a problem which solves a problem which, several levels of recursion later, solves the real problem you're working on.

**Elevator Pitch:** This website is a literate program (an
honest-to-god Web) which explores various ways to implement proof
assistants using Standard ML. For a longer discussion, see the
[about page](./about.md).

Also be aware: I am not using any site tracking analytics. **This site
uses no cookies.** The only Javascript used is
[KaTeX](https://katex.org/). The only CSS used is KaTeX's and a small
[CSS file](./infra/css/style.md).

Basically, we can partition the contents into the following "chapters":

- [Introduction](./intro/index.md) for background material
- [Standard ML](./sml/index.md) for our fragment of Standard ML and a
  programming tutorial (for Mathematicians who have never programmed)
- [Appendix: Infrastucture](./infra/index.md) governs how code is
  extracted, the web page is created, the stylesheets, and so on.

Feel free to file an issue on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ysg/site/issues)
or [Github](https://github.com/Yak-Shavers-Guild/site/issues) if you
spot an error, have a suggestion, or whatever.

If you find this website useful (or if you have feedback, have spotted
an error, etc.), drop a friendly email to 
`yakshaversguild AT gmail DOT <remove this> com`. 
I honestly have no analytics, so I don't know who all is reading this.

If you want to stay posted and receive low-frequency periodic emails
when I push out new chapters,
then email me (`yakshaversguild AT gmail DOT <remove this> com`)
asking to stay subscribed.
