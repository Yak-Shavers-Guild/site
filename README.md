This is the repository for the "main pages" of the Yak Shavers Guild.

The HTML output should be the `pages` directory located at `$YSG/pages/`.

This repository has a `Makefile` and assumes the user has already
built the `md` and `tangle-md` programs (for generating HTML from
Markdown, and extracting code from the Markdown code fences,
respectively) and they are located in subdirectories of the `$YSG/`
directory.
