# Untyped Lambda Calculus

Lambda calculus is a term rewriting system which describes the basic
mechanism of substituting expressions for variables inside another
expression. 

This serves as the "floor model" for many type theories, which are
used in programming languages and proof assistants.

Untyped lambda calculus also has an intimate relation to the concept
of "computation" (used in computer science). We will explore this
[elsewhere](computation.md). 

**Contents**

- [Syntax](syntax.md) introduces the underlying formal language
- [Operational Semantics](operational-semantics.md) treats untyped
  lambda calculus as a formal system
- [Church Encodings](church-encoding.md) describes how we can do
  arithmetic and "program" with untyped lambda calculus
- [Computation](computation.md) discusses the Church and Turing
  theses --- the punchline: untyped lambda calculus can describe our
  informal notions of "computing"
