# CSS for YSG

The basic style for the Yak Shavers Guild is contained in one giant
CSS file.

This website is supposed to be a "book" presented as a website, so
it's "text heavy". The style choices (font size, column width, and so
on) are made with this in mind.

- [style.css](./style.md) with some justification for the stylistic
  choices made
