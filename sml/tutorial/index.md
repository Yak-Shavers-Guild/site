# Tutorial on Standard ML

This focuses on teaching _Mathematicians_ how to program in (a purely
functional fragment of) Standard ML. We assume you are familiar with
the basic ideas discussed in the [Introduction](../../intro/index.md),
specifically typed lambda calculus.

Basically, Standard ML may be approximated as:
- Standard ML â‰ˆ Prenex Polymorphic Lambda Calculus + Algebraic Data
  Types + Modules

This is not strictly speaking true (there's more bells and whistles in
Standard ML that we won't need), but it's good enough for our
purposes.
