# Standard ML

This is our <i lang="la">lingua technica</i> for programming. We use
it to create tools as well as to implement proof assistants.

But since we do not assume our readers are programmers or computer
scientists, we should review some of the basics of programming.

- [Tutorial on Programming](tutorial/index.md) specifically for
  Mathematicians 
- [Axiomatic description](axioms/index.md) for our fragment of Standard ML 
  as a [deductive system](../intro/deductive-system.md)
- [Unit Testing](../sml-xunit/index.md)
