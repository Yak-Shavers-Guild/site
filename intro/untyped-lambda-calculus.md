# Untyped Lambda Calculus

Lambda calculus is a term rewriting system which describes the basic
mechanism of substituting expressions for variables inside another
expression. 

This serves as the "floor model" for many type theories, which are
used in programming languages and proof assistants.

Untyped lambda calculus also has an intimate relation to the concept
of "computation" (used in computer science). We will explore this
[elsewhere](computation.md).
