**Elevator Pitch:** This website is a literate program (an
honest-to-god Web) which explores various ways to implement proof

Also be aware: I am not using any site tracking analytics. The only
Javascript used is [KaTeX](https://katex.org/). The only CSS used is
KaTeX's and a small [CSS file](./infra/css/style.md).

Basically, we can partition the contents into the following "chapters":

- [Appendix: Infrastucture](./infra/index.md) governs how code is
  extracted, the web page is created, the stylesheets, and so on.
